ClawIO is a Cloud [Sync] Storage Gateway solution that provides excellent performance, reliability and scalability.

- **Cloud**: ClawIO core is a dependency-free autonomous server like Nginx or Apache that exposes a set of APIs that clients can consume
in a client-server architecture.

- **[Sync]**: ClawIO allows you to synchronize your data with existing synchronization software (currently only ownCloud is supported).
Sync is in [brackets] because Synchronisation is optional and can be disabled and enabled as you wish.

- **Storage**: ClawIO interacts with existing storage solutions from local filesystems to object storages.

- **Gateway**: ClawIO acts as a gateway to existing storage solutions providing a simple and effective HTTP API.

The project consists of several components:

- [ClawIO Server Daemon (clawiod)](https://github.com/clawio/clawiod/releases/)
- [ClawIO Web User Interface (webui)](https://github.com/clawio/webui/releases/)
- [ClawIO Terminal Controller (clawioctl)](https://github.com/clawio/clawioctl/releases/)
