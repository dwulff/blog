CERNBox is the biggest project I have being involved in. I joined this project when I was a Technical Student at CERN.
My bachelor thesis is about CERNBox and can be checked at [https://zenodo.org/record/58838#.V5iNnhV95sO](https://zenodo.org/record/58838#.V5iNnhV95sO)

The official description of the project is the following:

*CERNBox provides synchronisation capabilities between a user machine
(desktop PC, smart phone or tablet) and a central repository, 
managed by CERN IT department.*

*Currently it provides a functionality analogous to DropboxTM or similar system.
The data are stored on EOS, the disk-storage provided by the IT department for 
LHC computing. This allows users to access data via lxplus/lxbatch and, via 
synchronisation, from their mobile devices. The sync and web access layers are 
based on OwnCloud (http://owncloud.com (link is external)).*

## Technologies involved

* ownCloud
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS3
* PHP
* MySQL
* Apache
* NGINX
* LDAP
* EOS (CERN disk store for LHC)
