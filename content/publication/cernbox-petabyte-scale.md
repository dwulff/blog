abstract = "CERNBox is a cloud synchronisation service for end-users: it allows syncing and sharing files on all major mobile and desktop platforms (Linux, Windows, MacOSX, Android, iOS) aiming to provide offline availability to any data stored in the CERN EOS infrastructure. There is a high demand in the community for an easily accessible cloud storage solution such as CERNBox. Integration of the CERNBox service with the EOS storage back-end is the next step towards providing ’synchronisation and sharing‘ capabilities for scientific and engineering use-cases. CERNBox achieves the integration of ’synchronisation and sharing‘ capabilities with the LHC data analysis tools and transfer services. IT-DSS introduces CERNBox, a synchronisation and sharing service, to promote a new integrated way of accessing data for scientific research."
